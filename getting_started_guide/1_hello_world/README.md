# Hello World!
Just like in most programming tutorials, we're going to start with a Hello World example.
The type we'll be using is defined in hello_world.idl. Since the python version does not 
support static types, we can convert this to an xml file by running 
`rtiddsgen -convertToXml hello_world.idl`.

## Running the examples
To run, open two terminals. In one terminal run the publisher and in the other run the 
subscriber.
