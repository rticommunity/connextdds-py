# Getting Started with RTI Connext DDS in Python

This example walks you through the basic steps to learn about RTI Connext DDS in Python through 
several hands-on examples. These examples work toward creating a "chocolate factory", but these
patterns are common across many applications. The patterns we will be showing are:
* Streaming/sensor data (Temperature)
* State data (Chocolate Lot State)

An overview of the individual examples:
* Publish/Subscribe examples
    * 1_hello_world: First introduction to Connext DDS publish/subscribe.
    * 2_streaming_data: Data types and the streaming data pattern. Adding a new DataWriter.
    * 3_keys_instances: Introduction to keys and instances. Adding a new DataReader.
