Welcome to the RTI Connext Python API!
######################################

**RTI® Connext®** is a connectivity framework for building distributed
applications with requirements for high performance and scalability.

The **RTI Connext Python API** provides access to most Connext features from
Python.

.. attention::

    This release of the Connext Python API is experimental and provided as
    buildable source. As an experimental release, it cannot be used in
    production systems and is subject to change. A production-ready release is
    expected in the future.
